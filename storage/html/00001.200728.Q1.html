                    <p>Dear</p>
                    <h2>00001: ELM STREET, LONDON, UK</h2>
                  </div>
  <p>
    Further to your recent enquiry, we are pleased to present you with our scope of work and fee proposal for the above
    project.
  </p>
  <h2>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scope of work</h2>
  <div class="quote-block"><h2>A.1: CMP (for noise/vibration incl detailed predictions)</h2><p>This is random text number 1 guys, because I could not find it now, but who found can edit service when he wants.</p>
<p>Following the assessment of the sound insulation performance of the existing constructions, we
would review any available construction details in parallel with the survey results in order to
recommend any acoustic treatment and detailing as necessary.</p>
<p>The current construction performances will be reviewed against the requirements of the Building
Regulations, Approved Document E: ‘Resistance to the passage of sound’ (2003 Edition).
<p>The review would consider the requirements of the Building Regulations and any other relevant
British Standard as well as any specific client performance requirements.</p>
<p>A bespoke sound insulation upgrade solution, dependent on budgetary and performance
requirements would be proposed within our report, with references to proprietary materials and
suppliers as appropriate.</p> <h2>A.2: Planing Compliance Review</h2><p>A noise impact assessment of the plant installation would be produced based on the findingsof the environmental noise survey and the available plant proposals and layout drawings.</p><p>The suitability of the plant installation would be determined and any mitigation measures, such as acoustic screening, would be determined to satisfy the noise emissions criterion. Detailed calculations will accompany the report in order to demonstrate planning compliance.</p><p>We would liaise with the Local Authority, should it be necessary, in order to agree on a noise emissions criterion based on the measured background noise levels. Our assessment would be based on the following Standards and Good Practice Documents:</p><ul><li> BS4142: 2014: ‘Method for rating industrial noise affecting mixed residential and industrial areas’</li><li> BS8233: 2014: 'Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings - Code of Practice'</li><li> WHO Guidelines</li></ul><p>If compliance to the noise emissions criterion cannot be achieved within the flexibility of practical mitigation measures, a redesign / reselection of the plant units may be recommended. Any additional assessment of alternative plant installation schemes are not included in this scope of work, and may be subject to additional fees, as appropriate.</p> <h2>A.3: Planing Compliance Review</h2><p>A noise impact assessment of the plant installation would be produced based on the findingsof the environmental noise survey and the available plant proposals and layout drawings.</p><p>The suitability of the plant installation would be determined and any mitigation measures, such as acoustic screening, would be determined to satisfy the noise emissions criterion. Detailed calculations will accompany the report in order to demonstrate planning compliance.</p><p>We would liaise with the Local Authority, should it be necessary, in order to agree on a noise emissions criterion based on the measured background noise levels. Our assessment would be based on the following Standards and Good Practice Documents:</p><ul><li> BS4142: 2014: ‘Method for rating industrial noise affecting mixed residential and industrial areas’</li><li> BS8233: 2014: 'Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings - Code of Practice'</li><li> WHO Guidelines</li></ul><p>If compliance to the noise emissions criterion cannot be achieved within the flexibility of practical mitigation measures, a redesign / reselection of the plant units may be recommended.

    <h2>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PROFESSIONAL FEES</h2>
    <p>
      Our lump sum fees for undertaking the above scope of work would be as follows:
    </p>
    <table class="quote-price"><tr><td>A.1: CMP (for noise/vibration incl detailed predictions) </td><td style="text-align: right"><strong> £850 (+VAT)</strong> </td></tr> <tr><td>A.2: Planing Compliance Review </td><td style="text-align: right"><strong> £980 (+VAT)</strong> </td></tr> <tr><td>A.3: Planing Compliance Review </td><td style="text-align: right"><strong> £980 (+VAT)</strong> </td></tr></table>
    <p>
      The above fees are exclusive of VAT which will be charged at the prevailing rate, but inclusive of out of pocket
      expenses with the exception of air fares, hotel accommodation and visa costs. A clearance of 50% of the above fee
      would be required prior to undertaking any work, with the remaining funds to clear after the completion of the
      scope of work, or part thereof. Invoices will be raised to reflect the above payment schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that this scope of work reflects the time for office work, commensurate to the type and size of the
      project.
    </p>
    <h4>Revision Policy</h4>
    <p>
      Each revision of the noise modelling calculations and our technical report due to new information provided by the
      Client (such as, but not limited to, Gantt charts, equipment operations, or durations), would be charged at
      £650.00 (+VAT) as a fixed lump sum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any additional input for description amendments, or other Client requests will be charged at our standard hourly

    </p>
    <h2>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GENERAL</h2>
    <p>
      The overall procedure would be facilitated with the provision of any site plans, installation proposals
      (schedules, services drawings, and manufacturer’s noise emissions data) and/or relevant planning conditions.
      Copies of liaison / correspondence between relevant parties would be required where the subject matter is
      relevant.
