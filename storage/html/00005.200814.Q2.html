                    <p>Dear</p>
                    <h2>00005: <a class="address">66 Leicester Road, RM15 8JD, AVELEY, UK</a></h2>
                  </div>
  <p>
    Further to your recent enquiry, we are pleased to present you with our scope of work and fee proposal for the above
    project.
  </p>
  <div class="quote-block"><h2>A. SCOPE OF WORK</h2>
        <h2>A.1: Noise Impact Assessment</h2><p>The data from the noise survey would be analysed in accordance with the provisions of the
National Planning Policy Framework. A report would then be issued describing the
measurement procedure, the data analysis and the final outcomes.</p><p>A planning compliance review would also be produced, based on the findings of the environmental noise survey. The report would describe the suitability of the proposed plant installation and discuss any potential noise control measures to achieve the emissions
criterion.</p><p>In this respect, detailed acoustic calculations would be provided to demonstrate planning
compliance. This would require plant noise data from the mechanical consultant to demonstrate feasibility. We would arrange liaison with the Local Authority, if deemed
necessary, in order to agree to a noise emissions criterion.</p><p>A redesign / reselection of the plant units would be recommended, should the proposed
mitigation measures demonstrate non-compliance with the emissions criterion. </p>
 <h2>A.2: Commissioning of plant units (with unattended noise survey)</h2><p>This is random text number 12 guys, because I could not find it now, but who found can edit service when he wants.</p>
<p>Following the assessment of the sound insulation performance of the existing constructions, we
would review any available construction details in parallel with the survey results in order to
recommend any acoustic treatment and detailing as necessary.</p>
<p>The current construction performances will be reviewed against the requirements of the Building
Regulations, Approved Document E: ‘Resistance to the passage of sound’ (2003 Edition).
<p>The review would consider the requirements of the Building Regulations and any other relevant
British Standard as well as any specific client performance requirements.</p>
<p>A bespoke sound insulation upgrade solution, dependent on budgetary and performance
requirements would be proposed within our report, with references to proprietary materials and
suppliers as appropriate.</p> <h2>A.3: Meetings</h2><p>This is random text number 8 guys, because I could not find it now, but who found can edit service when he wants.</p>
