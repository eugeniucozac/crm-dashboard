                    <p>Dear</p>
                    <h2>00050: <a class="address">33 Holborn, EC1N 2HT, London, UK</a></h2>
                  </div>
  <p>
    Further to your recent enquiry, we are pleased to present you with our scope of work and fee proposal for the above
    project.
  </p>
  <div class="quote-block"><h2>A. SCOPE OF WORK 1 </h2>
        
        <h2>A.1: Environmental Noise Survey</h2><p>We would visit the site to undertake an environmental noise survey in order to assess the current noise profile of the area. The survey would be undertaken in accordance with ISO 1996-2:2007 Acoustics <i>“Description, measurement and assessment of environmental noise - Part 2: Determination of environmental noise levels”.</i></p><p>The survey would involve automated noise monitoring over a minimum period of 24 hours. All acquired data would be used to render a representative snapshot of the local background noise during daytime and night-time. Further manual measurements would also be conducted in order to assess any variations in the monitored noise levels due to specific noise sources.</p><p>During the survey, an inspection of the surrounding area would also be undertaken in order to identify the location of the nearest noise-sensitive receivers relative to the proposed plant unit location.</p> <p>The acoustic descriptors <i>LAmax, LA10, LAeq</i> and <i>LA90</i> would be measured in order to provide a more detailed understanding of the acoustic identity of the site and set noise emissions criteria, in accordance with the planning requirements of the Local Authority.</p> 
              
               <h2>A.2: Internal Surveys</h2><p>This is random text number 9 guys, because I could not find it now, but who found can edit service when he wants.</p>
<p>Following the assessment of the sound insulation performance of the existing constructions, we
would review any available construction details in parallel with the survey results in order to
recommend any acoustic treatment and detailing as necessary.</p>
<p>The current construction performances will be reviewed against the requirements of the Building
Regulations, Approved Document E: ‘Resistance to the passage of sound’ (2003 Edition).
<p>The review would consider the requirements of the Building Regulations and any other relevant
British Standard as well as any specific client performance requirements.</p>
<p>A bespoke sound insulation upgrade solution, dependent on budgetary and performance
requirements would be proposed within our report, with references to proprietary materials and
suppliers as appropriate.</p>
