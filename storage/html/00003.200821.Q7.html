                    <p>Dear</p>
                    <h2>00003: <a class="address">16 Walwyn Rd, ME17 5QR, CHART CORNER, UK</a></h2>
                  </div>
  <p>
    Further to your recent enquiry, we are pleased to present you with our scope of work and fee proposal for the above
    project.
  </p>
  <div class="quote-block"><h2>A. SCOPE OF WORK: PRE-TENDER ACOUSTIC STUDY </h2>
        This aspect of the Brief will be considered complete when all design recommendations, schedules and specifications have been issued. This section of the scope covers all necessary acoustic monitoring and measurements for all parts of the brief as stipulated in your invitation to tender.
        <h2>A.1: Architectural Acoustics</h2> 
              <h3>A.1.1: Room Acoustics </h3>
                  <p>Analysis of the reverberation characteristics of critical spaces will be undertaken with respect to surface treatments and room layouts. This would ensure that the acoustic environment within this space would be compatible with its dedicated function.</p> <h3>A.1.2: External Building Fabric </h3>
                  <p>Specifications of the external building fabric would be reviewed based on available detail drawings and the results of the existing environmental noise survey undertaken previously for the development.</p><p>This would include the specification of non-glazed building fabric elements, and roof constructions as required, in order to provide internal noise levels commensurate to the recommendations of BS8233:2014 and any other required standard as appropriate.</p> <h3>A.1.3: Internal Building Fabric </h3>
                  <p>Noise Rating (NR) criteria will be proposed for all sensitive spaces within the development. The overall NR specification will be based on practical considerations which will be taken into account.</p><p>These are:</p><ul><li>The function and acoustic identity of every space</li><li>Tolerance to external noise as well as to noise from building services</li><li>Speech intelligibility and privacy requirements</li></ul><p>A bespoke design review would be undertaken on the proposed internal building fabric with regards to sound insulation between spaces of varying functions. Detailed analysis of the separating floor and wall constructions would be undertaken to assess the likelihood of providing adequate acoustic separation, while recommendations would be made for additional acoustic treatment and detailing where necessary.</p><p>Specific design advice will be provided for internal building fabric issues associated with the following:</p><ul><li>Party wall, floor, and structure issues between low noise tolerance rooms and adjacent spaces</li><li>Potential noise breakout issues via the building’s external building fabric</li><li>Potential plant area and service riser issues</li></ul><p>Airborne and impact sound insulation criteria would be set for walls and floors separating adjacent spaces following the guidance set out in BREEAM Hea 13, Good Practice documents, as well as the Client’s aspirations.</p>
               <h2>B. SCOPE OF WORK: BUILDING SERVICES ACOUSTICS </h2>
        Recommendations for the construction and performance of Acoustic and Vibration Isolation Materials and Products will be issued for the guidance and information of the Design Team.  All acoustic criteria will be based upon the Client’s specifications.
        <h2>B.1: Planing Compliance Review</h2><p>A noise impact assessment of the plant installation would be produced based on the findingsof the environmental noise survey and the available plant proposals and layout drawings.</p><p>The suitability of the plant installation would be determined and any mitigation measures, such as acoustic screening, would be determined to satisfy the noise emissions criterion. Detailed calculations will accompany the report in order to demonstrate planning compliance.</p><p>We would liaise with the Local Authority, should it be necessary, in order to agree on a noise emissions criterion based on the measured background noise levels. Our assessment would be based on the following Standards and Good Practice Documents:</p><ul><li> BS4142: 2014: ‘Method for rating industrial noise affecting mixed residential and industrial areas’</li><li> BS8233: 2014: 'Sound Insulation and Noise Reduction for Buildings - Code of Practice'</li><li> WHO Guidelines</li></ul><p>If compliance to the noise emissions criterion cannot be achieved within the flexibility of practical mitigation measures, a redesign / reselection of the plant units may be recommended. Any additional assessment of alternative plant installation schemes are not included in this scope of work, and may be subject to additional fees, as appropriate.</p> 
              
               <h2>C. SCOPE OF WORK: POST-TENDER ACOUSTIC MONITORING </h2>
        We must approve all post-tender design changes, having any potential effect on the acoustic integrity of the project, before these are adopted.  The responsibility for gaining such clearance rests with the respective contractor(s), who will also be responsible for providing all associated relevant specifications, plant schedules and drawings.
        <h2>C.1: Planing Compliance Review</h2><p>A noise impact assessment of the plant installation would be produced based on the findingsof the environmental noise survey and the available plant proposals and layout drawings.</p><p>The suitability of the plant installation would be determined and any mitigation measures, such as acoustic screening, would be determined to satisfy the noise emissions criterion.

Any additional assessment of alternative plant installation schemes are not included in this scope of work, and may be subject to additional fees, as appropriate.</p> 
              
               <h2>C.2: Site Visit</h2><p>This is random text number 7 guys, because I could not find it now, but who found can edit service when he wants.</p>
<p>Following the assessment of the sound insulation performance of the existing constructions, we
would review any available construction details in parallel with the survey results in order to
recommend any acoustic treatment and detailing as necessary.</p>
<p>The current construction performances will be reviewed against the requirements of the Building
Regulations, Approved Document E: ‘Resistance to the passage of sound’ (2003 Edition).
<p>The review would consider the requirements of the Building Regulations and any other relevant
British Standard as well as any specific client performance requirements.</p>
<p>A bespoke sound insulation upgrade solution, dependent on budgetary and performance
requirements would be proposed within our report, with references to proprietary materials and
suppliers as appropriate.</p>
